Hey guys,

We would like to give more data from our projects to William.

One of the most common thing requested internally is the Sensitive API Key we use to execute programs through NFMS.

One of the thing the support team and I have thought about then, will be to give you guys out this key for training purposes, that way it will actually save time on both of our sides.

You'll find right here the X-Sensitive-API-KEY: "7h1515d3f1n1731y453n5171v34p1k3y"

Let me know if that sounds reasonable.

Santiago
